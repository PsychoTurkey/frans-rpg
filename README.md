Things that really should be changed:
- Make player ids telegram ids instead of their names (and change everything to print both ids and names)
- Marriage
- Generate and send image of the map
- Different group chats handling (unknown people, still be able to attack players in an empty group)
- Market - players can try to sell their items for a self-chosen price. They cannot use the item when its up fore sale! Limit it so that the market won't be overflown with items nobody wants (eg max number of items one person can try to sell at a time.)
- Loan function: get an amount of money (to your inventory gold), but all money you store in bank will be taken untill the loan has been repaid.
- I don't recall ever seeing one of the last words of items adjectives and names. The algorithm should be checked and tested.
- Have a toggleable pvp setting
- Make it comply to PEP8 standards
- Reference player case insensitive
- Deposit() return message should have a capital D
